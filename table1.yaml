ervebo:
  vaccine:
    Ervebo (rVSV-ZEBOV-GP; V920; rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP)
    Monovalent, expresses EBOV GP (Kikwit variant)
  manufacturer:
    - Merck
    - NewLink Genetics
    - PHAC (National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba)
  advantages:
    - Only vaccine with proven clinical efficacy
    - Rapid immunostimulatory properties
      enable its use in an outbreak setting or
      as an emergency postexposure prophylactic
    - Single-dose approach eliminates the
      need for patient follow-up
    - Good safety profile, 2 SAEs reported
      deemed related to the vaccine (febrile
      reaction and anaphylaxis) that later
      resolved
    - Durable humoral immunity, strong
      immune responses reported at least 2
      years after vaccination
    - Lower doses of vaccine needed than
      adenovirus-based vaccines
  disadvantages:
    - Only targets EBOV, which was
      responsible for the 2013–2016
      outbreaks and more recent flare-ups
    - Only licensed for adults >=18
      years of age
    - Reports of arthritis in a subset of
      vaccinees associated with
      increasing age and increased IgG
      titers beyond 6 months
    - Infectious virus found in synovial
      joints of vaccinees suggests unlikely
      but possible vaccine shedding/
      secondary transmission
    - Requires >=60  C storage
      temperature; −60 C to −80 C
      stability is 36 months, 2 C to 8 C
      for no more than 2 weeks, room
      temperature for no more than 4
      hours
  status:
    - Licensed by US FDA and EMA
    - Granted Breakthrough Therapy
    - Designation by the US FDA and PRIME status by the EMA
    - Phase III trials completed in Africa, the US, Canada, and Europe
    - Expanded access protocols used in Guinea and in the DRC
    - Tested in children older than or equal to 1 year (PREVAC),
      women that later became pregnant, and HIV–positive individuals;
      appears immunogenic and safe but still examining its suitability
      in these populations
    - Durability, antibody threshold of protection?
    - Safety and immunogenicity in the immunocompromised and
      pregnant/lactating women?
zabdeno:
  vaccine:
    Zabdeno/Mvabea (Ad26.ZEBOV + heterologous MVA-BN-Filo boost)
    Multivalent after second dose, Zabdeno expresses EBOV GP (Mayinga)
    Mvabea expresses EBOV GP, SUDV GP, TAFV NP, and MARV GP
  manufacturer:
    - Johnson & Johnson (Janssen division)
    - Bavarian Nordic
  advantages:
    - Approved for individuals 1 year and older
    - Good safety profile, 2 SAEs reported deemed related to vaccine
      (Miller Fisher syndrome and small fiber neuropathy) that later resolved
    - Multivalent after second dose; targets EBOV, SUDV, and TAFV as well as
      MARV (although, only indicated for EBOV)
    - Replication deficiency eliminates
      vaccine shedding concerns
    - Multiple storage options:
      - Ad26.EBOV −20 ̊C to −60 ̊C for 48 months and +2 to +8 ̊C for 12 months
      - MVA-BN-Filo 20 ̊C to −60 ̊C for 42 months and +2 to +8 ̊C for 6 month
  disadvantages:
    - Lower predicted vaccine efficacy than Ervebo (approximately 53%)
      based on stringent nonhuman primate bridging data
    - Requires 2 doses (patient follow-up cause for concern)
    - Not ideal for outbreak settings as 8 weeks must pass before the
      second dose is administered
    - High doses of vaccine required for immunogenicity compared to Ervebo
    - Booster vaccination recommended 4 months post second dose
    - Mvabea does not include immunogen targeting Bundibugyo
      or Bombali ebolaviruses
    - Data on cross-protection against non-EBOV or MARV does not exist
    - Preexisting immunity to vector may reduce the effectiveness of the
      vaccine
  status:
    - Licensed by EMA under exceptional circumstances
    - Phase I/II/III trials completed in Europe, the US, and Africa
    - Submitted dossier to the US FDA to request licensure using the
      Animal Rule
    - Submitting to WHO for EUAL
    - Other vaccine combination/variants are being explored to enhance
      immunogenicity/efficacy of Zabdeno and Mvabea
    - Durability, antibody threshold of protection?
    - Safety and immunogenicity in the immunocompromised and
      pregnant/lactating women?
