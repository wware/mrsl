# An example "machine readable" paper

I am not an academic and this will not be a real paper. It will certainly
not be publishable. But the hope is to write a very rough draft of a
"paper" that employs a mix of ordinary text and semantic markup of some
kind, and ideally, to demonstrate how this markup might be used to
extract machine-comprehensible content from the paper and perform
some kind of deduction or reasoning on it.

> ### What is the current status, and what are some advantages and disadvantages, of the leading Ebola virus vaccines?
> Thirteen EBOV vaccine candidates have entered human clinical trials with 5 progressing to
post-Phase I clinical trials [8]. Strengths and weaknesses for each of the 5 platforms are sum-
marized in Table 1. The most advanced vaccines in the United States and Europe include Ervebo (rVSV-EBOV), Zabdeno/Mvabea (Ad26-ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo), and cAd3-EBOZ
(Fig 1). All 3 platforms use a viral vector, or a modified version of a harmless surrogate virus,
to provoke an immune response. Key benefits of virus-vectored vaccines are their ability to
deliver antigen specifically to target cells and to induce robust, long-lived immunity.
> Ervebo, Zabdeno/Mvabea, and cAd3-EBOZ all express EBOV glycoprotein (GP) antigen to stimulate
an immune response. GP is the sole surface protein of the EBOV virion and mediates attachment, fusion, and entry of target cells; thus, this protein serves as an attractive immunogen as
it is readily recognized by the immune system and is the main target of the neutralizing anti-
body response [9]. Some general disadvantages of virus vaccine vectors include manufacturing
obstacles, cold chain requirements, and difficulty in adapting to new virus variants.

Let's try to render Table 1 in Turtle.
